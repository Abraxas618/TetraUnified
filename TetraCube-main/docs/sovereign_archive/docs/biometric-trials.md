# 🧬 Biometric Trials – 10 User Baseline

This trial simulates a biometric entropy evaluation using EEG, voiceprint, and hashed DNA markers. The goal is to analyze entropy drift, spoofing resistance, and QIDL stability under real-world identity reconstruction pressure.

## 🛡 Liveness Detection Defense

- 🔹 **Temporal entropy** from `time_ns()` prevents deterministic replay
- 🔹 **Random salt** from `os.urandom(16)` introduces QIDL drift
- 🔒 All replay attempts failed due to liveness mismatch signatures

> **Status**: Awaiting delivery of Epoc X 14-channel EEG headset  
> Future trial will extend entropy benchmarking with increased spatial resolution and biometric coverage.
