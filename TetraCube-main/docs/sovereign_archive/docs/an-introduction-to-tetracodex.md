## ‚úÖ Final Repository Declaration

This repository, **TetraCodex**, is the **complete integration** of the Codex encryption stack:

- üß© `TetraCrypt-PQC-Nexus`  
- üåê `TetraCrypt_Yggdrasil_Unified`  
- üß† `TetraYggdrasil_Nexus`  

All code, circuits, and documentation are consolidated and **verified by entropy**.  
The project is **frozen** for reproducibility, and formally sealed on World Quantum Day.

## üìú Abstract

The **Codex Constitution** introduces a post-linear biometric identity framework based on:

- Recursive Poseidon hashing
- Dodecahedral swarm vector geometry
- Drift-based entropy injection from biologic + time
- zkSNARK circuits with Groth16

This produces a system where **identity is a time-function of being**, mathematically enforced through **non-replayable entropy injection**.

üß¨ Identity = `f(user_state, time_ns, entropy_stream)`

This resists quantum spoofing, biometric forgery, and zero-trust adversarial infiltration.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

| File / Folder | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `zk/` | Live zero-knowledge circuit + script |
| `docs/Proof/` | Final ZK proof bundle (r1cs, wtns, zkey, jsons) |
| `Codex_Constitution.pdf` | [Codex Constitution Whitepaper](./The%20Codex%20Constitution%20A%20Sovereign%20Swarm%20Framework%20for%20Biometric%20Trust%20and%20Post-Linear%20Ethics%20(1).pdf) |
| `compile.sh` | Shell script to compile and prove |
| `README.md` | You are here |
| `powersOfTau28_hez_final_12.ptau` | Phase 1 trusted setup |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The `zk_trust_js/` folder is unnecessary ‚Äî witness was compiled via script.

---

## üîê Core ZK Flow

```bash
npm install -g circom snarkjs
sudo apt install nodejs npm

chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
```

Expected output:

```
[INFO] snarkJS: OK!
```

This validates:  
- `zk_trust.circom` ‚Üí `.r1cs`  
- `input.json` ‚Üí `.wtns`  
- Proof ‚Üí `proof.json`, `public.json`  
- Verification ‚Üí via `verification_key.json`

---

## üß† The Math Behind It

The zk circuit leverages:

- `Poseidon(2)` hashing over `F_p`
- Recursive time-injected entropy:
  ```ts
  H(user_entropy + os.urandom() + time_ns())
  ```
- Groth16 proof over a rank-1 constraint system (R1CS)
- Drifted hash identity vectors projected into a dynamic swarm mesh

The final `.wtns` file encodes identity state, validated by entropy waveform stability.

## üß™ ZK Integration Instructions (Verified 100% Working)

This project includes a zero-knowledge proof module located in the `/zk/` directory. It has been fully tested and verified on Ubuntu 24.04 and WSL2 environments with Circom v2 and SnarkJS.

### üöÄ To Run the Codex ZK Circuit

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install -g circom snarkjs
```

2. Navigate to the zk directory:
```bash
cd ./zk
```

3. Clone circomlib (Poseidon hashing dependency):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iden3/circomlib.git
```

4. (Optional) Download `.ptau` if not included:
```bash
wget https://hermez.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/powersOfTau28_hez_final_12.ptau
```

5. Run the full pipeline:
```bash
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
```

This will:
- Compile the zk_trust.circom circuit
- Generate a witness
- Create a Groth16 proof
- Verify the proof
- Output `proof.json`, `public.json`, `verification_key.json`

‚úÖ If working correctly, you will see:
```
snarkjs: OK!
```

I, Michael Tass MacDonald, also known as Abraxas618, born on Treaty 8 territory and residing at Chicken 224, Saskatchewan, Canada, hereby declare the following:

I. Identity & Background
I am a Canadian citizen and a self-taught D√´nes≈≥≈Çin√© technologist.

I independently designed and developed the TetraCrypt Codex Encryption System as a post-quantum, sovereign cryptographic framework.

My work was produced entirely without foreign sponsorship, government contracting, or commercial funding.

II. Purpose of Work
TetraCodex was created to advance:

Decentralized digital identity (DID)

Indigenous sovereignty in cyberspace

Open-source post-quantum encryption

Ethical AI-aware trust infrastructure

It was not created for military targeting, surveillance, or autonomous weapon systems.

III. DRDC Submission
I did submit a version of the Codex to Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) under Canada‚Äôs open innovation and R&D programs (e.g., IDEaS).

This submission was made:

As a voluntary public contribution, not a contracted engagement

Without expectation of compensation, control transfer, or classified development

For academic and national cyber defense resilience, not weaponization

Any derivative military or surveillance application of this work by DRDC or affiliated defense entities is done without my endorsement or participation.

IV. Jurisdiction & Protection
I retain full authorship and intellectual sovereignty over the project.

Under:

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms

UNDRIP (UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples)

Open-source licensing (Apache 2.0 / MIT)
I assert the right to define and limit the use of my creation according to ethical and lawful principles.

V. Legal and Ethical Disclaimer
The Codex is provided without warranty, and I accept no liability for:

Misuse by governments, militaries, intelligence agencies, or corporations

Unauthorized forks, deployments, or weaponized adaptations

Violations of privacy, ethics, or Indigenous data sovereignty using this tool

My published legal disclaimer (in README and Zenodo record) reaffirms this public stance.

VI. Final Affirmation
This declaration is made in truth and in peace, to protect both my person and my vision.
It is archived as a digital marker of intent and may be used in any court, tribunal, or investigative proceeding to clarify authorship, purpose, and responsibility.
I submitted a version of the TetraCodex system to Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) as part of an open-source national cybersecurity contribution.

I included references to theoretical military applications‚Äîsuch as swarm-based identity authentication, trust-layer IFF, and sovereign mesh defense‚Äîto illustrate the system's potential for defensive use.

These references were made for public analysis and academic simulation only, and not as part of any:

Contracted weapons development

Government-authorized defense program

Operational military integration plan

I explicitly disclaim the use of this work in any classified or unauthorized military context without my consent. Any such use is undertaken solely by the party involved, without my endorsement or liability.
